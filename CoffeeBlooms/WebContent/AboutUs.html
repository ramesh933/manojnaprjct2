<h1> Welcome to our coffee house</h1>
<h2> Good Ideas Starts with BrainStorming But Great Ideas start with coffee</h2>
<h3> Use of coffee : In addition to helping you feel less tired and more alert, 
     the caffeine in coffee may improve your mood, brain function, and exercise performance. ...
     Many people enjoy drinking coffee first thing in the morning. Yet, some people assert 
     that having it on an empty stomach may harm your health.</h3>
<h2> Our moto is to serve coffee and make them happy from their tensions</h2>
